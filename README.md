# The-Great-Unknown
Classes to create background stars, foreground stars, glowing effects and signs of alien life. 

Images in this should be TRANSPARENT images. That is how I got the highly detailed images of galaxies and nebulas in the background. 

THE CODE IS NOT PERFECT. Some things, like the connecting white lines between glowing dots in this -likely- have a better algorithm for them.


I didn't have the time to figure that out and I figured it would save me time by doing it the slightly more complicated way. 
Each star for the constellations was put on a coordinate grid and mapping the distances by a piece of paper and a ruler off of my screen (yes, really)

After a while of searching, it seemed like there wasn't any good method to add a 'glowing' effect to a mobject. I found code online that I slightly changed
to my preference to create a very similar effect from 3B1B's videos. That can be found under the 'GlowDot' class.

I'm not in college and only took a few computer sciences classes in high school, so it may show in the code. I am perfectly open to criticism, if anyone is reading this. 


Have fun! I would absolutely love to see what else can be made from these ideas. I'm proud to create something I haven't seen on the subreddit before. Much love!!
